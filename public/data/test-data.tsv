Their armored exoskeletons help protect them from larger predators such as octopi, but giant spider crabs also use camouflage. The crab's bumpy carapace blends into the rocky ocean floor. To further the illusion, a spider crab will adorn its shell with sponges and other animals. Using it's claws to twist and tear off the organism, such as a worm tube or sponge, from the substrate on which it currently resides. Once the materials are attach to the crab, the organism are able to regenerate, and colonize to further the enhance the camouflage.

Swordfish	Saltwater	Xiphias gladius	125	50	1,500		10	14.11	Tropical, temperate, and sometimes cold waters in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans	Near Threaten			The swordfish is named after its long pointed, flat bill, which resembles a sword. Like most billfish, their speed and mobility gives them the advantage for catching prey (potentially swimming 50 mph / 80 kph). However, due to it's unique flat bill, the swordfish does not use it's bill to stab prey like other members of the billfish, but rather slashing their bill back and forth, to stun or injury it's prey. They have developed unique characteristics, such as a special eye muscles and a heat exchange system that allows them to swim in deep, cold water in search of prey. During the day, they commonly occur to depths of 550 m (1,800 ft) and have exceptionally been recorded as deep as 2,878 m (9,442 ft) Swordfish feed at the top of the food chain and are rarely preyed on by other animals.

Common Carp	Freshwater	Cyprinus carpio	10	6	112		18-26	4.75	Literally everywhere theres freshwater; native to Eurasia	Least concern			The common carp is often considered a destructive invasive species, being included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species. A typical adult female can lay 300,000 eggs in a single spawn, over a million eggs in a year.  In absence of natural predators or commercial fishing, they may extensively alter their environments due to their reproductive rate and their feeding habit of grubbing through bottom sediments for food. In Australia, they attempted to make a koi herpes virus to control the population, but opted to genetically modify the carp so they only produce male offspring. In Utah, United States, they catch the common carp and give it to people who will eat them or turn them into fertilizer. Another way to control the population is to catch them in seine nets and expose them to piscide reotenone. In Central Europe, the common carp are more commonly used as food comparitive to other regions, finding itself in traditional meals Christmas Eve meals. 	Common

The lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) is a species of shark from the family Carcharhinidae, known for its yellowish color, which inspires its common name. It is classified as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.[4] Lemon sharks can grow to 3.4 metres (11 ft) in length. They are often found in shallow subtropical waters and are known to inhabit and return to specific nursery sites for breeding. Often feeding at night, these sharks use electroreceptors to find their main source of prey, fish. Lemon sharks enjoy the many benefits of group living such as enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. This species of shark gives birth to live young, and the females are polyandrous and have a biennial reproductive cycle. Lemon sharks are not thought to be a large threat to humans; there have been 10 recorded bites, none of which were life-threatening. The lemon shark's life span is unknown, but the average shark is 25 to 30 years old.[5] The oldest recorded lemon shark in captivity died in 2023 at the age of 40 years.[6]

Least Concern		Do you want to hear a joke? 	The ocellaris clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris), also known as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish, is a marine fish belonging to the family Pomacentridae, which includes clownfishes and damselfishes. Amphiprion ocellaris are found in different colors, depending on where they are located. For example, black Amphiprion ocellaris with white bands can be found near northern USA, North America, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Japan.[3] Orange or red-brown Amphiprion ocellaris also exist with three similar white bands on the body and head. Amphiprion ocellaris can be distinguished from other Amphiprion species based on the number of pectoral rays and dorsal spines. Amphiprion ocellaris are known to grow about 11 cm (4.3 inches) long.[4] Like many other fish species, females are, however, larger than males.[3] The life cycle of Amphiprion ocellaris varies in whether they reside at the surface or bottom of the ocean. When they initially hatch, they reside near the surface. However, when Amphiprion ocellaris enter into the juvenile stage of life, they travel down to the bottom to find shelter in a host anemone.[5] Once they find their anemone, they form a symbiotic relationship with them.[3][6]

Their fame, as well as their name, comes from their feeding method - gouging round plugs as if with a cookie cutter from larger animals. Marks have been found on marine mammals, fish, underwater cables and submarines, but also eat smaller (like some squid species) whole. They're generally not considered dangerous to humans but there have been documented attacks. Also considered to have the strongest bioluminescence out of any shark species through the luminous glands (photophores) on its underside and use it to match the downwelling light and hide their silhouette - a strategy known as "counter-illumination". They're sometimes a nuisance due to the damage they cause to submarines and commercial fishing nets.

The pelican eel, also sometimes called a gulper eel, is a species of deep-sea eel and the only known member of it's genus and family. Their morphology is difficult to study due to their fragility and the damage they suffer when taken out of their high-pressure deep-sea habitat, but their most notable feature is the pelican-esque mouth, which is also why they're called pelican eels. Their mouth is loosely-hinged and capable of swallowing fish much larger than the eel itself and the jaw is estimated to be a quarter of the size of its body. It's usually folded but can be inflated when hunting and any water that enters their mouth while eating is expelled through the gills. The pelican eel also has a whip-like tail that is used for movement, as well as bioluminescence through a complex organ that glows pink. They're also especially dark in color due to their ultra-black pigmentation which reflects less than 0.5% of light, which allows them to be essentially cloaked in darkness in their low-light environment.

Depth range of 0 to 913m (0 to 2995ft) below sea level, but most commonly between 50 and 400m (160-1310ft). Most commonly near the sea floor in sandy, muddy or rocky reef environments	Least Concern	bottom trawl nets	"Not a mousefish, but it will save the lionfish regardless"	A chimaera found in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Chimaeras are an order of cartilaginous fish, known also as ghost sharks, ratfish etc. At one point in history abundant, their closest relatives are rays and sharks, though they split off 400 million years ago. They're for the most part confined to deeper waters. Called by those names presumably due to their ghostly appearance and ratlike face and tail. Chimaeras are soft-bodied, shark-like fish with bulky heads and long, tapered tails, as well as large pectorl with which they generate lift, resembling flying. Some species, including the spotted ratfish, also have a venomous spine on the tip of their dorsal fin for defense. The spotted ratfish itself is a comparatively shallow-dwelling species (usually found between 50 and 400m or 160-1310ft) and migrates towards shallower waters during the spring and autumn. Also unlike its deeper-dwelling relatives, it has been held and bred in public aquaria.	
Longhorn cowfish	Saltwater	Lactoria cornuta	0.07	0.03	0.34		0.37	0.8	Tropical and subtropical waters, Red Sea and East Africa eastward through Indonesia to Marquesas, northward to southern Japan. Including Tuamotus,  southern Korea, north to the Ryukyu islands of south Japan, south to Australia and Lord Howe island. Primarily in coral reefs in lagoons, on reef flats, estuaries, bays and protected seaward reefs.	Least Concern	hand-held net	"Holy Cowfish!"	A species of marine ray-finned fish, belonging to the boxfish family. It's recognizable by its long horns that resemble those of a cow or a bull. The boxfish family (Osctraciidae) have a unique method of swimming, called ostraciiform swimming where they mostly use their tail fin to swim, causing them to look like they're hovering. They also lack pelvic fins and a gill cover (operculum). Some of the species can release a toxin as defense, with the longhorn cowfish having an allegedly unique deadly toxic among fish. The horns of the cowfish may have evolved to make it harder to swallow. Their scales are fused into a triangular box-like carapace, from which the fins and tail portrude. Often used as aquarium fish.	
Bowmouth guitarfish	Saltwater	Rhina ancylostoma	244	214	273		6.3	8	Widely distributed in the coastal tropical waters of the western Indo-Pacific. From South Africa to the Red Sea  across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia to Western Australia.  	Critically Endangered	trawls, gillnets, line gear	"You can tune a piano, but you can't tune a.. oh.."	A species of ray, whose evolutionary relationship with other rays is still debated. Currently considered a species from the wedgefish family, in the same order as true guitarfishes and sawfish, though it may actually be more closely related to true guitarfishes or skates. Both guitarfish and wedgefish are famous for their unique look - morphologically between a shark and a ray, even if not genetically. Despite being rays they have a very shark-like tail. True guitarfish are bottom feeders and bury themselves in the mud or sand looking for worms, crabs and clams. The bowmouth guitarfish is considered a strong swimmer and mainly feeds on demersal bony fish, crustaceans, bivalves and cephalopods, though its been observed feeding on pelagic species too. It's more active at night but not known to be territorial and the tiger shark prays on it. The ray is protected by the thorns on its head and back and may ram perceived threats. The bowmouth guitarfish, alongside other similar species, is widely used in the fin trade for shark fin soup. It's considered endangered mainly due to fishing, habitat destruction, blast fishing, coral bleaching and other reasons.	
Mimic Octopus	Saltwater	Thaumoctopus mimicus	12.5	5	20		2.1	2.3	Inhabits the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the Red Sea and and Gulf of Oman in the west to New Caledonia in the east, Gulf of Thailand and the Philippines in the north and the Great Barrier Reef in the south. Most documented observations are from Indonesia and it's primarily found in areas with sand or silt at depths of less than 15m (49ft)	Least Concern	octopus traps, nets, trawls	 "A dime for the mime?	A species of octopus from the Indo-Pacific region. Although a lot of species have chromatophores and can disguise themselves, the mimic octopus is notorious for mimicking other marine creatures like lionfish by holding its arms out radially, sea snakes by hiding 6 arms and sticking two out parallel to each other, and many others, but flatfish might be its preferred disguise. It can match said mimicry to the situation, for example mimicking a banded sea snake, a known damselfish predator, to scare off damselfish. It's not only used to defend against predators, but sometimes as aggressive mimicry to approach wary prey - for example mimicking a crab as an apparent mate.	
Giant Tiger Prawn	Saltwater	Penaeus monodon	0.6	0.3	1		0.83	1.08	Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, as far as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and northern Australia. invasive species in the northern waters of the Gulf of Mexico[4] and the Atlantic Ocean off the Southern U.S	Not Evaluated	bottom trawls	"Prawn to biting"	Large marine crustacean, widely used for food. It's name comes from it's size as well as the bands on its carapace. Considered an invasive species in some regions and generally found in estuaries and mangroves, moving into deeper waters upon adulthood. They're nocturnal in the wild, coming out to feed at night and burrowing into the substrate during the day. They feed on detritus, polychaete worms, mollusks and small crustaceans, as well as algae.	
Hairy Frogfish	Saltwater	Antennarius striatus	0.55	0.44	0.66		0.76	0.82	Tropical and subtropical waters from the Indian Ocean to the center of the Pacific Ocean, and in the Atlantean  Ocean on the western coast of Africa, from New Jersey to southern Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.	Least Concern	bottom trawls	"Ribbit"	A marine ray-finned fish, belonging to the frogfish family, anglerfish order. They're small, short and stocky and sometimes covered in small spines and other appandages to aid in camouflage, used for protection against predators and luring prey. Many of them can change colour and some are covered in algae or hydrozoa. In keeping with camouflage, they typically move slowly and lie in wait, striking extremely rapidly. They rarely move in general, but if they do it's usually walking across the sea floor with their pelvic fins or slowly "galloping" with the help of their pectoral fins, rarely ever swimming. Rather than typical dorsal fins, the front-most three fins are replaced by an illicium or "rod" that is topped with an esca or "lure". If lost the esca can be regenerated and both the illicum and esca can be withdrawn into a depression for protection when they are not needed. The hairy frogfish (also called sirated frogfish)'s latin name comes from "antennarius", referring to the lure on its head, as well as "striatus" referring to the black stripes along its body.	
Giant oceanic manta ray	Saltwater	Mobula birostris	5950	5300	6600		15ft	30ft	Widespread distribution in tropical and temperate waters worldwide.	Endangered	surface drift gillnets, bottom set nets, harpoons		The giant oceanic manta ray, also called giant manta ray or oceanic manta ray, is the largest species of ray in the world. It's of the family Mobulidae (manta rays and devilfishes), consisting mostly of large species living in the opean ocean, rather than on the sea bottom. The giant oceanic manta ray is flat, with large triangular pectoral fins, small dorsal fin and a whip-like tail. Unlike the devilfishes, mantas lack a spiny tail, having a knob-like bulge at the base of the tail instead.

Lack of information aside, coming back to port with a cooler full of Queens will raise eyebrows, as they’re not the easiest fish to catch!	
Lake whitefish	Freshwater	Coregonus clupeaformis	8		41.8878		1.7749344		Found mainly in large, cold, freshwater lakes and their tributaries. They make small, seasonal migrations between different water depths.		Whitefish do most of their feeding at night, use a small hook with a light line, typically baited with a single salmon egg, wax worm, or small minnow, and fish near the bottom of the lake in deeper areas, often using a jigging motion		They are covered in scales that range from pea green or almost brown dorsally to silvery white ventrally. The sides have a bluish hue and the fins are nearly transparent. There are two dorsal fins, including an adipose fin which is sometimes larger in males.	
Bonito	Saltwater	Sarda sarda	12	10	24		1.47638	2.59186	Lives in coastal surface pelagic habitats in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Seas		Bonito are attracted to flashy lures with silver in them use sardines, anchovies, and herring or dead baitfish for bait.		These schooling pelagics share their family with Tuna and Mackerel are caught in a similar manner. The Sarda genus, which they belong to, is comprised of the Striped, Australian, Pacific and Atlantic Bonito, the latter two being the most prevalent. Not very popular as game on the East Coast of the US, these fish are the essential warm up catch for charter fishing in California.	
Conger Eel (Europian counger)	Saltwater	Conger conger 	3 m						Conger Eels make themselves at home in cozy nooks and crannies, usually in rocky areas and shipwrecks. Close to shore, they often hide around structure like piers, jetties, and breakwaters.		using whole live fish, hooked through the upper jaw behind the lip, with mackerel, pouting and whiting being the best options. Whole freshly killed fish can also be effective, with squid, herring, or pilchards working well. Crabs and lobsters can also be used to fish conger eels		A variety of Eels belong to the Conger genus, including the largest species on the planet. Most of the time, recreational anglers catch European Conger and American Conger Eels, two saltwater species which inhabit these areas of the world.	
Dogfish	Saltwater	Squalidae	20 lbs				2-3 feet long		Live in shallow waters, while others inhabit the deep.		use a simple one or two hook "flapping" rig with a size 1/0 or 2/0 hook, and bait it with oily fish like mackerel strips, squid, or sandeel		There may be no Shark more plentiful on this planet than the Dogfish Shark. To be precise, this family of relatively small Sharks consists of 72 different species, but when most people talk about Dogfish they’re usually referring to Squalus acanthias, a.k.a. Spiny Dogfish. This particular species goes by many names, including Spurdog, Skittle Dog, Dog Shark, Common Spiny Fish, Spotted Spiny—you get the idea. This little guy may even hold the record for most aliases in the English language!	
Herring	Saltwater	Clupea	2 lbs				12 inches long		Pacific Herring is found in the seas north and east of Russia, near Japan and Korea, and all across the West Coast of the US (from Alaska to the north of Baja California). Atlantic Herring inhabits the East Coast of the US, all around the British Isles, France, and Scandinavia.		use a light, soft fishing rod with small, flashy lures like feathers or tinsel, and gently jig the lure up and down in the water column, keeping it relatively still to mimic their natural food		The name “Herring” is used for many different species of fish that can be found all over the planet, from the North Pole to the sunny side of New Zealand. The two most popular species are the Atlantic Herring and Pacific Herring. Can live both in salt and fresh water.	
John Dory	Saltwater	Zeus faber	2.2 lbs						Live in a variety of habitats, including open sand, muddy grounds, rock structures, reefs, weed edges, rocky shorelines, wharves, and break walls. They prefer areas that provide cover, such as harbours and ports, where they can ambush their prey. 		using live baits and have a net ready		John Dory have large dark spots on the sides of their bodies, thought to have a defensive role and confuse predators. They are also able to change colors and blend into the background, where they wait patiently for slow moving prey, which they suck into their extendable mouths.	
Murray Cod	Freshwater	Maccullochella peelii	13 lb						Murray cod can be found in small, clear streams, as well as large, slow, and fast-moving rivers. They prefer deep holes with cover from large rocks, fallen trees, stumps, claybanks, and overhanging vegetation.		a quality graphite rod with a braided line use a fine gauge hook so you can penetrate the fish's tough mouth without bending it and for baits try larger lures, spinnerbaits, or live bait		The largest fish in the world that only lives in fresh water, the Murray Cod is an undisputable reason to visit the Murray-Darling River system in Australia. Severely overfished in the 1800s and early 20th century, they are gradually making a comeback, but conservation measures are still important to keep the fishery healthy and sustainable. But when the season opens, catching a Murray Cod has got to be one of the most exciting experiences you can get in Southeastern Australia. 	
Pike Perch (Zander)	Freshwater	Sander lucioperca 					50.0 cm		Adults inhabit large, turbid rivers and eutrophic lakes, brackish coastal lakes and estuaries. Feed mainly on gregarious, pelagic fishes.		using a light tackle spinning rod with a lure or live bait, often employing jigging techniques to entice bites		Pike Perch, commonly known as Zander, is a staple of European freshwater fisheries. It bears resemblance to its American cousin, the Walleye, making it easy to confuse one for the other when you’re looking at a photo. Its characteristic stubbornness made Zander fishing popular with sport anglers.	
Rainbow Runner	Saltwater	Elagatis bipinnulata	10	8	39				Adults are found in oceanic and coastal waters, generally near the surface over reefs or sometimes far from the coast often around floating logs or other debris		Live and cut fish, squid, octopus, and crustaceans. You can also try deep-diving lures, surface lures, and saltwater flies			
Salmon (Pink)	Freshwater	Oncorhynchus gorbuscha 	5	3	15				Pink salmon are found along the Pacific rim of Asia and in North America. There are naturally occurring pink salmon populations throughout the coastal waters of the North Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean and nearby seas.		By using a fly rod include trolling with plugs, squids, and spoons, or drifting and mooching natural baits like cut herring		Pink Salmon are the most commonly occurring Pacific Salmon species, but that’s not to be confused with “boring” or “typical!” This breed has a few tricks to keep anglers on their toes. When they live in the ocean, Pink Salmon have a bright silver appearance; when they return to the rivers to spawn, however, they change to a pale grey color with yellow-white bellies. Spawning males also develop a hump on their upper backs, hence the secondary name “Humpback Salmon” or “Humpies.” If their shape-shifting abilities aren’t enough to impress you, their agility surely will. Cast your line in the right place at the right time, and these fish will bring some great light tackle action to your fishing trip!	
Salmon (Chinook)	Freshwater	Oncorhynchus tshawytscha	15	5	98				Chinook Salmon are native to the west coast of North America, from Alaska down to central California. These fish have also been introduced to a number of lakes, including Lake Tahoe and the Great Lakes. Top Chinook Salmon fishing locations include the Kenai River in Alaska, Campbell River in British Columbia, the Sacramento River in California, and the Columbia River, which flows through Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.  		Use a long rod, which may be paired with a wide variety of reels including spinning, baitcasting, and more. Lures, cut bait, and live bait can all be effective depending on conditions		Many refer to Chinook Salmon as “King Salmon,” a title which certainly suits this fish. As the largest of the Pacific Salmon species, Chinook have gained a legendary reputation among anglers on the west coast of Canada and the United States. From the Pacific Ocean to mighty rivers such as the Sacramento and Columbia, nothing says “go hard or go home” like King Salmon fishing.	
Samson Fish	Saltwater	Seriola hippos	40	33	132				Samson Fish are native to southern Australia, New Zealand, and Norfolk Island. Anglers frequently catch Sambos in Western Australia, as well as New South Wales and southern Queensland. This fish inhabits offshore structure such as wrecks, reefs, gas platforms, and oil rigs, where it can make the most of a mixture of shallow and deep water. Anglers find this fish in water as deep as 100 m.		Bottom fishing with live mackerel, herring, whiting, and squid, or jigging with knife jigs		Samson Fish (commonly called Sambos) have a reputation for being one of the hardest-fighting species in the sea. Samsons are often confused with their close relative, the Amberjack, but you can distinguish a Sambo by its deep body and the abnormally broad corners of its jaw. For anglers in southern Australia, these fish are the definition of a good workout!	
Sierra Mackerel	Saltwater	Scomberomorus sierra 	20	1	18				This feisty fish usually inhabits inshore coastal waters, and can be found anywhere from Southern California all the way down to Southern America. They’re an especially popular catch when it comes to surf fishing, with Mexico’s Pacific Coast being an especially productive locale.		Use either light tackle or fly gear, as this means that the hard-fighting action that these fish provide can really be appreciated. Due to this species’ ferociously sharp teeth, wire leaders and lines are recommended		Often referred to as the “mini Wahoo” thanks to its shape and speed, the Sierra Mackerel is truly a force to be reckoned with. This member of the Scombridae family gives an impressive run at the end of a line, and its strength makes it the perfect opponent for fly and light tackle anglers alike. It’s also a prized eating fish, so you’ll be rewarded with tasty table fare at the end of your battle.	
Snapper (Red)	Saltwater	Lutjanus campechanus	7	3	55				Red Snapper are temperate fish. You’ll find them exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico and along the southern Atlantic Coast. Locations off the Florida Panhandle, including Destin, Panama City, and Pensacola, are considered some of the best for fishing. Texas is another great alternative, with Galveston and Port Aransas hosting impressive numbers.		Heavy rods and 50–80 lb test lines are necessary. As for bait, squid or cut fish are good choices		Every year, anglers line up to go fishing for Red Snapper. And it’s no wonder why! These fish are highly sought-after in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast on account of their excellent flavor, distinctive looks, and game qualities.	
Tarakihi	Saltwater	Nemadactylus macropterus	1.5kg.						Found in high density in the inner and mid shelf, while the adults reside on the outer continental shelf. This species has a diet of benthic invertebrates including polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms.		Dropper or a flasher rig, using a variety of small baitfish or strip fish such as skipjack or pilchard		These bottom dwellers can be compared to Pink Snappers, however they only grow to a fraction of Squire sizes. They are schooling fish normally present over reefy/rocky bottoms up to 100m deep, but also caught from the shore at certain locations.	
Tigerfish	Freshwater	Hydrocynus vittatus					18” and 24”		This fish is very prolific and can be found in large rivers and lakes all over Africa – from Egypt to South Africa. You’ll find them near the bottom of a body of water, only coming up closer to surface during daytime to hunt. As the sun goes down so does the fish, into the depths.		Use sharp hooks, and a bite trace. For baits use a static line and dead bait, like pilchards. Allow the fish to take the bait before striking		One of Africa’s most iconic freshwater predators, African Tigerfish fishing is practically the backbone of freshwater angling on the continent. Their striking appearance, impressive strength, and razor-sharp teeth make them the perfect target for your next trophy!	
Tailor Fish	Saltwater	Pomatomus saltatrix 							They are most common along surf beaches and rock headlands in clean, high energy waters, although adults can also be found in estuaries and into brackish water		Longer surf-style rods and use large baits (dead or live ones)		Also known as the bluefish in the United States, the Pomatomus saltatrix is rennowed wherever it is found for its stong fights and good taste on the dinner table. An excellent light tackle game fish, it comes under the name of Tailor in Australia.	
Tuna (Blackfin)	Saltwater	Thunnus atlanticus 	7				about 40''		Found in oceanic waters, sometimes not far from the coast. Forms large mixed schools with the skipjack tuna. Its spawning grounds are located well offshore. Preys on surface and deep-sea fishes, squids, amphipods, shrimps, crabs and stomatopods and decapod larvae. 		Commonly caught trolling or spin casting natural or artificial bait		The species is considered to be one of the toughest light tackle fish, with flesh quality comparable to that of the Yellowfin. What the Blackfin lose in size, they make up in numbers and willingness to bite.	
Rock Bass	Freshwater	Ambloplites rupestris	3.1				15.4 cm	43.0 cm 	he rock bass can be found in the eastern regions of Canada, as well as certain other parts of North America. This species belongs to the sunfish family and, in Canada, lives in the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes water system. Within these bodies of water, this fish prefers clear waters and rocky habitats. 		Use fly fishing with hellgrammites and earthworms as baits.			
Lake chub	Freshwater	Couesius plumbeus	4 lbs				10.5 cm	23.0 cm	Inhabits virtually any body of water, standing or flowing, large or small. Common in gravel-bottomed pools and runs of streams and along rocky lake margins. Mostly found in shallow water, but may move to deeper parts of lakes during hot weather. Feeds on zooplankton, algae, terrestrial and aquatic insects, and small fishes.		Using bait, trolling, and pole fishing in areas where they are likely to be found		Couesius plumbeus is distinguished by having the following characters: barbel at corner of large, barely subterminal mouth; moderately pointed snout; large eye; head flattened above and below; dorsal fin origin over or slightly behind pelvic fin origin

Anadromous in coastal streams. Stocked in almost all water bodies as lakes, rivers and streams, usually not stocked in water reaching summer temperatures above 25°C or ponds with very low oxygen concentrations. Feed on a variety of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates and small fishes. At the sea, they prey on fish and cephalopods. 		Most popular fishing technique is bobber/float fishing with a jig or bait such as worms, prawns, crayfish tails, sand shrimp or, their favorite, cured fish eggs.		Body elongate, somewhat compressed especially in larger fish. No nuptial tubercles but minor changes to head, mouth and color occur especially in spawning males. Colouration varies with habitat, size, and sexual condition; stream residents and spawners darker, colours more intense; lake residents lighter, brighter, and more silvery. 	
Muskellunge	Freshwater	Esox masquinongy	40	2.2	70		95.0 cm 	183 cm	Lives in clear vegetated lakes, quiet pools and backwaters of creeks and small to large rivers. Solitary, lurking hunter on other fishes as well as on ducklings, muskrats, and snakes. Oviparous, spawn in spring as the ice melts.				Muskellunge are the largest member of the pike family, they resemble the northern pike in most respects, but are distinct in the following respects. The sides vary from greenish to brownish to silverish, usually with dark markings, but the marks may be absent. The white or cream-colored belly often has brownish or grayish spots.	
Walleye	Freshwater	Sander vitreus	24.2				54.0 cm	107 cm	Occurs in lakes, pools, backwaters, and runs of medium to large rivers. Frequently found in clear water, usually near brush. Prefers large, shallow lakes with high turbidity. Rarely found in brackish waters. Feeds at night, mainly on insects and fishes (prefers yellow perch and freshwater drum but will take any fish available) but feeds on crayfish, snails, frogs, mudpuppies, and small mammals when fish and insects are scarce.				Walleyes are relatively small for predatory fish, reaching an average adult size of 350mm among males and 450mm among females. Walleyes are darkly colored on top, with colors ranging from brown, to olive, to dark yellow with a paler underside, ranging from white to pale yellow. Walleyes have silvery eyes that have a reflective underlayer, which causes it to reflect in the dark. Their mouths contain a series of very sharp teeth, specialized for a piscivorous lifestyle.	
Flathead catfish	Freshwater	Pylodictis olivaris			123			155 cm	Adults inhabit pools with logs and other debris in low-gradient to moderate-gradient, small to large rivers. Also found in lakes and impoundments. Young occur in rocky and sandy runs and riffles. Juveniles feed on aquatic insect immature in riffle areas. Older individuals consume crayfish, clams and fishes.				This is a large-bodied species that can attain sizes of over one meter in length and 56 kg in weight. Flathead catfish are also called mud catfish, because of their yellow to purple-brown dorsal coloration. The belly is pale white to yellow. Not surprisingly, their head is wider and flatter than that of other North American catfishes.Flathead catfish have both pectoral and dorsal-fin spines.	
Longnose gar	Freshwater	Lepisosteus osseus			22.8 kg		17.5 cm	200 cm 	Adults occur in sluggish pools, backwaters and oxbows of medium to large rivers, and lakes. Usually found near vegetation.

Voracious predator, feeding on various fishes and crustaceans. The roe is poisonous.				Longnose gar have long, narrow snouts more than twice as long as the rest of the head and they have abundant, sharp, villiform teeth. Mature L. osseus are olive brown in color with a white belly. Dark spots can be found on the median fins and, in individuals from clear water, on the body.	
Northern pike	Freshwater	Esox lucius			28.4 kg		40.0 cm	137 cm	Occurs in clear vegetated lakes, quiet pools and backwaters of creeks and small to large rivers. Usually solitary and highly territorial. Enters brackish water in the Baltic. Adults feed mainly on fishes, but at times feed heavily on frogs and crayfish. Cannibalism is common.				They can be identified by their single dorsal fin and light-colored spots along their dark body. They are also recognized by scales that cover their entire cheek and the upper half of their gill covers. Their close relative, the muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), have scales covering only the upper half of their cheek and gill covers. The sides of E. lucius vary from dark shades of green to olive green to brown, with 7 to 9 rows of yellowish, bean-shaped spots. The underside is white to cream-colored.	
Pumpkinseed	Freshwater	Lepomis gibbosus			630.00 g		9.9 cm	40.0 cm	Pumpkinseeds are freshwater fishes, like other members of the sunfish family, Centrarchidae. They prefer cool to moderately warm, clear water that is 1 to 2 m deep in areas with lots of vegetation for cover. The ideal water temperature for pumpkinseeds ranges from 21 to 24 degrees Celsius.				Pumpkinseeds are deep-bodied and laterally compressed. They have brassy yellow to olive green sides that are densely covered with spots of bright copper or gold. The opercle flap has a distinctive crimson spot in a half-moon shape on the rear edge in adults. In young pumpkinseeds a pale spot on the opercle flap distinguishes them from other Centrarchidae.	
Largemouth black bass	Freshwater	Micropterus salmoides			10.1 kg		40.0 cm	97.0 cm	Largemouth bass live mainly in lakes and rivers. The optimal habitat for this species include slow moving, quiet, clear waters with soft, shallow substrates. Dense vegetation is ideal for avoiding predation and being predators themselves. Although largemouth bass tend to stay in shallow water with a depth of 0.3-4 meters, they migrate during the winter to deeper water, 5-15 meters.				Largemouth bass have bodies that are both elongated and thick. They are the largest of the black basses, reaching a maximum recorded adult length of 97 cm and a maximum recorded adult weight of 10.1 kg.The color of largemouth bass is generally olive-green, but some have been reported to be a stripe along their body. This bass has a large mouth that extends beyond the posterior edge of their eye which is what tends to separate them from other species, such as the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu.	
Bluegill	Freshwater	Lepomis macrochirus			2.2 kg		19.1 cm	41.0 cm 	Adults are found frequently in lakes, ponds, reservoirs and sluggish streams; occur primarily in reservoirs in Hawaii; preferably live in deep weed beds. Active mainly during dusk and dawn. They feed upon snails, small crayfish, insects, worms and small minnows. Young feed on crustaceans, insects and worm.				Like other sunfish, bluegill have very deep and highly compressed bodies. In other words, they are "tall" and "flat." They have a small mouth on a short head. The dorsal fin is continuous, with the front part spiny and the back part soft and round with a dark smudge at the base. The tail fin is slightly forked but rounded. The body is mainly olive green with yellowish underneath. Their name "bluegill" comes from the iridescent blue and purple region on the cheek and gill cover (opercle). A close look reveals six to eight olive-colored vertical bars on the sides.	
Sheepshead	Saltwater	Archosargus probatocephalus 	5	1	9.6 kg 		35.0 cm	91.0 cm 	Inhabits bays and estuaries. Freely enters brackish waters; sometimes enters freshwaters (Ref. 26938). Commonly found around pilings. Caught by anglers from jetties or rocky shores (Ref. 9988). Feeds mainly on mollusks and crustaceans.				The Sheepshead is an exquisitely beautiful and tasty light tackle fish. Popularly referred to as "convict fish" due to its symbolic coloration, the nickname holds true on account of its notorious bait stealing skills as well.	
Spanish Mackerel	Saltwater	Scomberomorus maculatus 	5	2	5.9 kg			91.0 cm	Spanish mackerel live in the subtropical and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean.

They are iridescent blue-green on their backs and silver on their sides. They have large, triangular jaw teeth that are closely spaced and flattened.	
Tripletail	Saltwater	Lobotes surinamensis 	12	2	19.2 kg 		80.0 cm	110 cm	This fish lives in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, except for the eastern Pacific Ocean. It can be found in coastal waters, estuaries, and the lower reaches of freshwater streams.Tripletail are commonly found lazying on the surface around any type of flotsam, especially buoys, or just drifting with the coming currents, imitating other floating objects (hence their nickname, buoyfish). They can also be found close to jetty/pier pilings or in deeper water around ship wrecks.			It's okay, little Tripletail. We got you. We'll make you famous.	The tripletail has a rounded dorsal and anal fin, small scales, and a head profile that becomes more concave with age. Juveniles are leaf-like and mottled with yellow, brown, and black, while adults are jet black.	
Bowfin	Freshwater	Amia calva	5	1	19		53.4 cm	109 cm	Bowfin live in backwater pools of rivers, lakes, and swamps. During times of high water, bowfin swim into river cutoffs and ther floodplain habitats. Often times they are trapped here when the water level decreases. Due to their ability to breath air they can survive in these drained ponds for relatively long periods of time.				Amia calva are most easily recognized by two distingushing features. The first is a very large gular plate located on the ventral side of the head, between the mandibles. This plate is unique among fishes that live within the bowfin's geographic range (Trautman, 1957). The second distingushing feature is a very long dorsal fin. The fin has 46-50 soft rays and covers approximately 42.7-47.5% of total body length.	
Coalfish	Saltwater	Pollachius virens	8	7	32.0 kg		60.0 cm	130 cm	An active, gregarious fish occurring inshore and offshore waters. Usually enters coastal waters in spring and returns to deeper waters in winter. Smaller fish in inshore waters feed on small crustaceans (copepods, amphipods, euphausiids) and small fish, while larger fish prey predominantly upon fishes. Coalfish are found in the cold waters of the Northern North Sea, Baltic Sea, Scandinavian and Icelandic waters, and the eastern coast of the USA and Canada.				Coalfish (or Pollock) are brownish-green dorsally with the color becoming more pale ventrally. They have a pale, smooth lateral line that is interrupted. The body is fusiform. They have a small chin barbel and a terminal mouth (Cohen et al. 1990). Although there is evidence that some populations may be geographically isolated, there is no evidence that there are any important genetic differences between populations (Mayo et al. 1989). Adult pollock can reach maximum lengths of 130 cm but are usually less than 110 cm (Collette and Klein-MacPhee 2002).	
Hapuka	Saltwater	Polyprion oxygeneios	50	45	180lbs			160 cm	Hapuka normally come to shallower waters to spawn throughout the summer, which means greater numbers, but the winter conditions are more conducive of reaching greater depths, which means bigger fish. In general, the fishing is good year-round. Inhabit all southern oceans and can be found off South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Tristan da Cunha, Australia and New Zealand. Australian hotspots include Jurien Bay, WA and the waters south of Robe, SA; New Zealand has excellent fisheries in Fiordland and the Chatham Islands.				A large, long-lived perch-like fish that may grow to a length of 1.8 metres, and live to more than 60 years. In Australia, Hapuku are taken as bycatch in deep-sea dropline fisheries targetting Blue-eye Trevalla.	
Dotted gizzard shad	Saltwater	Konosirus punctatus					9.8 in	13 in	Found off coasts and in bays, but migrating into shallower brackish water for breeding, at least in Ariake Sound (south Kyushu), where spawning takes place far up the Sound in April and May. Individuals apparently spawn twice or more during the season.				They have a compressed body, a slightly projecting snout, and a dark spot behind their gills with several lines of dark dots next to it. 	
Japanese sardine	Saltwater	Sardinops melanostictus	0.05	0.2			15-20 cm	24.4 cm	Japanese sardines live in schools in coastal waters and can sometimes be found in bays.They spawn in the open ocean and in semi-enclosed shoreline habitats in the spring.				Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) is a significant small pelagic fish and a valuable resource that plays an essential ecological role in the marine ecosystem. It is present in the far Eastern Asian maritime waters, including the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, and the East China Sea. Encircling nets, particularly purse seines, are the most used fishing equipment to catch this species. Their fishing grounds are located entirely in coastal areas.	
Ivory Shell	Saltwater	Babylonia areolata	17.5 grams 						The Babylonia areolata, also known as the ivory shell or spotted babylon, lives in muddy sand bottoms at depths of less than 15–20 meters				Babylonia areolata is a marine snail of the class Gastropoda. Previously, B. areolata has been exploited primarily for domestic consumption demand, but in many recent years it has become a rather important export item in several Southeast Asian countries.	
Oval Squid	Saltwater	Sepioteuthis lessoniana	2.5	0.89			1.5 to 13.0 in		Sepioteuthis lessoniana is a large muscular squid found in shallow waters up to 100m depth. They are typically found on coral reefs and seagrass meadows, moving in to coral reefs particularly at night to feed.				Like other members of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to distinguish from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle.The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish,[citation needed] a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet at the back of the squid.	
Yellow perch	Freshwater	Perca flavescens	1.1 kg		1.9 kg 		19.1 cm 	50.0 cm	Yellow perch are found mainly in lakes and sometimes in impoundments of larger rivers. Clear water is important as excessive turbidity and silt could lead to death of perch. Perch do however have a high tolerance for low oxygen conditions. They inhabit water of moderate temperature, avoiding cold deep water and warm surface waters during the summer. Young perch generally inhabit shallower water than larger ones, though as temperature increases all move to cooler, deeper water (Walden 1964; Herman et al 1959).				Adult yellow perch are usually golden yellow; young are usually more whitish. There are 6 -- 8 dark vertical bars on the sides of these fish. Their eyes are green to yellow. They have a spiny dorsal fin with 12 -- 14 spines and a second dorsal fin with 12-13 soft rays plus 2-3 spines. There is usually a blackish blotch on the membrane between the last 3 or 4 dorsal spines. Their anal fin has 2 spines and 7-8 soft rays. The lower fins of adults are usually tinged yellow or red; this is especially noticeable on males during breeding season. The lateral line is prominent and curved with 51-61 scales along it. Yellow perch have rough feel because they have ctenoid scales.	
Blackthroat seaperch	Saltwater	Doederleinia berycoides					30.0 cm 	40.0 cm	This ray-finned fish lives in the temperate ocean waters of the eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, from Japan to Australia. It can be found at depths of 100–600 meters.				A reddish seabass becoming silver below with a large red eye, reddish fins, a black margin on the spinous dorsal and caudal fins, a black mouth cavity, and large deciduous scales.	
Hogfish	Saltwater	Lachnolaimus maximus 	6	2	20 pounds			36 inches	 Hogfish are often found in areas with abundant gorgonians, and are commonly found over open bottoms and coral reefs. Hogfish are found in the Western Atlantic Ocean, from Nova Scotia, Canada, to northern South America, including the Gulf of Mexico.				Hogfish are named after their elongated pig-like snout, which they use to burrow around sandy bottoms for crustaceans and mollusks. Their sharp canine teeth help crush the shell of their prey and 24 long filamentous dorsal spines add to the exotic, odd appearance of this fish. The signature Hogfish gape is wide enough to fit this angler's head in!	
Asian arowana	Freshwater	Scleropages formosus	12	10	16		3	4.5	Native to Southeast Asia, Asian arowanas inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and wetlands	Endangered	Rod		Asian arowana are considered a symbol of good luck and prosperity, especially by those from Continental Asian cultures. This reputation derives from the species' resemblance to the Chinese dragon, considered an auspicious symbol in Chinese mythology. The large metallic scales and double barbels are features shared by the Chinese dragon, and the large pectoral fins are said to make the fish resemble "a dragon in full flight."  Asian arowana scales can vary heavily in colors: Green, silver Asian ("grey tail silver" and "yellow tail silver"), rd-tailed golden, gold crossback, blue Malayan, or Bukit Merah blue, and red, super red, blood red, or chili red.  The price for Asian Arowana can vary heavily based on color, pedigree (if bred from earlier wild caught generation), and Fin size and head shape. Chili Red Ariwabas cab cist $1,400. Emerald-Violet fusion super reds can cost $12,000. Albino arowanas can cost as much as $70,000 up to $300,000.	Super Rare
